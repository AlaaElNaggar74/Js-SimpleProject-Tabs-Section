            LForwards (also known as attackers) are outfield positions in an
            association football team who play the furthest up the pitch and
            are therefore most responsible for scoring goals as well as
            assisting them. As with any attacking player, the role of the
            forward relies heavily on being able to create space for
            attack.[1] Attacking positions generally favour irrational players
            who ask questions to the defensive side of the opponent in order
            to create scoring chances, where they benefit from a lack of
            predictability in attacking play. Team formations normally include
            one to three forwards. For example, the common includes one
            forward.[2] Less conventional formations may include more than
            three forwards, or none.[3][4]
